# Django REST API Untangler

This project refactors a Django REST API endpoint for improved readability, maintainability, and robustness. The code is restructured to handle errors gracefully, ensure consistent return values, and log important events.

## Changes Made

1. **Encapsulation in ApiManager Class**: The entire logic is encapsulated within the `ApiManager` class to enhance modularity and maintainability.
2. **Refactored into Smaller Functions**: The code is broken down into smaller, single-responsibility functions within the `ApiManager` class.
3. **Consistent Return Values**: The function now consistently returns `HttpResponse` objects with appropriate HTTP status codes.
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling is added to manage various error scenarios gracefully.
5. **Centralized Logging and Response Handling**: Logging and response handling are centralized in the `StatusMsg` class to keep the code clean and maintainable.
6. **Atomic Transactions**: Database operations are wrapped in atomic transactions to maintain data integrity.
7. **Configurable Variables**: Hard-coded values are replaced with configurable variables for better flexibility and maintainability.
8. **Optimized `obj.save()` Call**: The `obj.save()` method is called only once after all updates are done to ensure that all changes are saved in a single transaction. This approach reduces the risk of partial updates and maintains data integrity.
9. **Signal Handling in ApiManager**: The `post_save` signal handler is now a static method within the `ApiManager` class for better encapsulation and modularity.

## Usage

To use this refactored endpoint, create an instance of the `ApiManager` class and call the `rest_endpoint` method with the appropriate input object. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and Django settings are configured correctly.

```python
class Input:
    def __init__(self, id: int, name: str, type: str, details: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.type = type
        self.details = details

input_data = Input(id=1, name="test", type="bank_account", details={})
api_manager = ApiManager()
response = api_manager.rest_endpoint(input_data)
print(response)
